# Gamma Ray Spectroscopy
## Summary
Sixth lab experiment from my second year undergraduate in Physics at The University of Manchester. Note that no lab report was written for this experiment.

The aim of this experiment was to calculate the quantities of radioactive isotopes in mud and rock samples. This was done through analysing high energy gamma spectra along with accounting for real world inefficiencies such as detector calibration and detector efficiency. To obtain high precision results, I went significantly beyond what was required in the lab script by using chi-square minimisation in my data analysis and also using chi-square contour analysis.

## Technical Highlights
* Chi-Square minimisation to fit non linear functions to the data (Inverse Polynomial)
* Chi-Square contour analysis
* Linear Regression
* Data visualisation in matplotlib
* 
## Files
* Gamma Spectroscopy Lab Script.pdf contains a brief outline of the experiment given to me before I started.
* Gamma Spectroscopy Notebook.pdf contains my handwritten notes from during the experiment including a schematic diagram, key figures, snippets of the recorded data, calculations, data analysis and conclusions. 
* Gammacurve.py, GammaEffpy and gammarocks.py contain all the data analysis, plotting and other code for the lab experiment.
