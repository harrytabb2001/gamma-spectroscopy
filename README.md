Third lab experiment from my second year undergraduate in Physics at The University of Manchester. Note that no lab report was written for this experiment.

* Gamma Spectroscopy Lab Script.pdf contains a breif outline of the experiment given to me before I started.
* Gamma Sepctroscopy Notebook.pdf contains my handwritten notes from during the experiment including a schematic diagram, key figures, snippets of the recorded data, calculations, data analysis and conclusions. It is worth noting that I went significantly beyond what was required in the lab script by using chi square minimisation in my data anaylsis, and also using chi square contour analysis to calculate high precision errors on my results.
* Gammacurve.py, GammaEffpy and gammarocks.py contain all the data analysis, plotting and other code for the lab experiment.
