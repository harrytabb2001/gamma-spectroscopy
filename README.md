Third lab experiment from my second year undergraduate in Physics at The University of Manchester. Note that no lab report was written for this experiment.

* Gamma Spectroscopy Lab Script.pdf contains a breif outline of the experiment given to me before I started.
* Gamma Sepctroscopy Notebook.pdf contains my handwritten notes from during the experiment including a schematic diagram, key figures, snippets of the recorded data, calculations, data analysis and conclusions.
* Gammacurve.py, GammaEffpy and gammarocks.py contain all the data analysis, plotting and other code for the lab experiment.
